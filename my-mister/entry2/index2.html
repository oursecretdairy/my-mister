    <p>“My Mister” tells the story of a young, impoverished woman named Ji-An (played by IU), struggling with debt and caring for her sick grandmother, who forms an unexpected bond with her middle-aged, overworked supervisor, Dong-Hoon (Lee Sun-kyun), who is also dealing with a dysfunctional family and workplace pressures. As they navigate their difficult lives, they find solace and healing in each other, gaining and learning about human-to-human relationships, despite keeping secrets about their pasts and circumstances.<br><br>
       The comforting and powerful words and scripts of the story have been a great influence on me as well, and I also wanted to let others feel the same emotions that I felt while watching this drama. Each page explores different famous lines or lines that I found comforting, exploring the different ways for others to feel similar emotions.
